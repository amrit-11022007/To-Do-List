A simple stylish and functional to do list web application built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project helped me learn DOM manipulation, event handling, theming and UI logic in real world scenarios.

Features:
1. Add task with date and time.
2. Delete individual tasks
3. 5+ Different switchable themes.
4. Add task using Enter key or Add button.
5. Smart visibility (list hides when empty).
6. Real time UI update.

Note: Date and Time doesn't work properly for smaller devices, but great for PC.

Tech used:
HTML5
CSS3
Javascript (Vanilla)

What I learned:
1. DOM transversal and Manipulation.
2. Using classLists, appendChild, addEvenListners, trim().
3. CSS variables and some properties like object-fit, pointer-events.
